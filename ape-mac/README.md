## Introduction

This is a port of [Monkey's Audio Codec][monkeys-audio] to Unix-like systems. It provides a command line utility and a library that can be used by other programs.

Monkey's Audio Codec is a lossless compressor for audio files. Files in this format can typically be recognized by the *.ape* extension. Other popular lossless compression formats are Xiph.Org's [FLAC][] and Apple's [ALAC][].

This port is based on Monkey's Audio Codec version 3.99 and integrates patches for [shntool] compatibility. Silly licensing restrictions have hampered the development of a healthy ecosystem around this codec. Using it for anything other than decoding existing files is thus discouraged.
